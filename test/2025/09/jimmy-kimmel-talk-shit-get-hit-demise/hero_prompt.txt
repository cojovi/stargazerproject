A dramatic cinematic portrait of a fallen late-night talk show host in a darkened studio, empty audience seats stretching into shadows, broken spotlight casting harsh dramatic lighting across an abandoned desk, scattered papers and overturned coffee mug, somber mood with deep blues and grays, realistic photography style with high contrast lighting, television screens in background showing static or "off air" message, symbolic of consequence and downfall, studio equipment covered in dust, melancholic atmosphere

Lighting: Single harsh spotlight from above creating dramatic shadows
Color palette: Deep blues, grays, muted yellows from old tungsten lights
Style: Cinematic realism, high contrast, moody atmosphere
Aspect ratio: 16:9
