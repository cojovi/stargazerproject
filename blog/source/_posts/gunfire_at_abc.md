You know things are getting weird in this country when a TV station is shot at the day after people protest a late-night show host’s suspension. That's where we are—and yes, “radical leftist attorney arrested for shooting ABC station” sounds like it came out of a dystopian script, not real life. But here we are.

Here’s the latest on the Sacramento ABC10 shooting, the Jimmy Kimmel fallout, and what — if anything — might connect it all. And yeah, we believe in free speech. Even when it gets ugly.

## What happened: the basic facts

- **When & Where**: Friday, September 19, 2025, around 1:30 p.m. PT, Sacramento ABC10’s (affiliated with Tegna) lobby was struck by at least *three bullets*.  [oai_citation:0‡EW.com](https://ew.com/shots-fired-abc-tv-news-station-in-sacramento-11814065?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Who was arrested**: A 64-year-old Sacramento man named Anibal Hernandez-Santana was taken into custody.  [oai_citation:1‡San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/sacramento-abc10-gunfire-arrest-21058523.php?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Charges**: Assault with a deadly weapon, shooting into an occupied building, and negligent discharge of a firearm.  [oai_citation:2‡The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/police-arrest-man-suspected-of-shooting-into-a-sacramento-abc-news-station?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- **Damage / Injuries**: Windows shot out; lobby window hit; building occupied at the time. **No injuries** reported.  [oai_citation:3‡EW.com](https://ew.com/shots-fired-abc-tv-news-station-in-sacramento-11814065?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## What led up to this: the Kimmel drama

- Jimmy Kimmel’s show was suspended, “indefinitely,” after controversy surrounding his comments on Charlie Kirk’s death — namely, who killed him, how politics might play into public perception, etc.  [oai_citation:4‡People.com](https://people.com/gunfire-struck-abc-sacramento-affiliate-station-11814083?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  
- Protests erupted outside ABC10 in Sacramento **the day before** the shooting. Not massive, maybe ~15 people, but clearly saying “We believe ABC is censoring free speech” and calling out the suspension of Kimmel.  [oai_citation:5‡People.com](https://people.com/gunfire-struck-abc-sacramento-affiliate-station-11814083?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  

So questions immediately arose: Was the gunfire related to those protests? Was Hernandez-Santana (if he is the shooter) motivated by radical left beliefs? Was this politically driven? So far, investigators *have not confirmed* any direct connection to the protest or to Kimmel’s suspension. Motive remains under investigation.

## What *we know* vs rumors

Here’s where fact diverges from what some media and social media outlets *wish* was true:

| Claim | Status / Reality |
|---|---|
| Shooter is a “radical leftist attorney” | **Unsubstantiated**. Sources say Hernandez-Santana is 64, and arrested; no confirmed public records (so far) show he is an attorney or radical leftist. Some articles claim “anti-Trump” social media posts, but that does *not* equal proven motive.  [oai_citation:7‡New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/09/20/us-news/sacramento-man-arrested-in-abc10-news-station-shooting/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| Shooting was definitely political retaliation connected to Kimmel protests | **Unclear**. Protests happened; building was shot into the next day. But police have explicitly said motive is under investigation and not yet determined.  [oai_citation:8‡The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/police-arrest-man-suspected-of-shooting-into-a-sacramento-abc-news-station?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |
| Somebody was hurt | **False**. No injuries reported.  [oai_citation:9‡EW.com](https://ew.com/shots-fired-abc-tv-news-station-in-sacramento-11814065?utm_source=chatgpt.com) |

## The bigger picture: Why this matters (beyond the headlines)

1. **Free speech is under pressure from all sides.**  
   Yes, we *do not* agree with radical leftist ideologies. But punishing, censoring, or suspending voices (e.g. late-night hosts) sets dangerous precedents. And when a suspension triggers protests and potentially violence or threats, it’s no longer just speech — it’s become a tinderbox.

2. **Political polarization + reactive media = explosive combination.**  
   When people believe any media action is part of a political conspiracy, trust erodes. And then any violent act (or rumor of one) gets amplified—often inaccurately.

3. **Accountability & facts are crucial.**  
   Before rushing to a narrative (e.g. “radical leftist attorney shot the station to support Kimmel”), we need evidence: background of suspect, motive, communications. As of now, none of that is verified.

4. **Media companies are also under strain.**  
   Tegna (“owns” ABC10 affiliate), the broader ABC/Disney network, Nexstar (if the acquisition goes through) — all are in tight spots. They face legal, public relations, and safety concerns, especially with employees in buildings being shot at.  [oai_citation:10‡The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/20/police-arrest-man-suspected-of-shooting-into-a-sacramento-abc-news-station?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

## Our stance (yes, we *do* have one)

- We believe in *free speech*, even (especially?) when it’s messy. Suspending shows and punishing hosts should have high bar, transparency, and due process.  
- We *oppose* radicalism—on the left or the right—that resorts to violence or threats. That includes shooting into buildings.  
- We *demand rigor* in reporting. No more “attorney” tag without proof. No more “radical leftist” label just because someone protests or is critical of conservatives.  
- We recognize that the left is not always innocent, nor is every conservative protest purely ideological. The truth is often gray. And no, more censorship or blanket bans are not the answer.

## What to watch now

- Will more details about Hernandez-Santana’s background emerge? Is he actually a lawyer? What do his public posts say? Truly radical? Or just frustrated?  
- Will police tie him to the Kimmel protest explicitly? Any communications, plans, or confession?  
- How will ABC / Tegna / Nexstar respond in terms of security, policy, and whether the show (Kimmel’s) returns or stays off air?  
- Will this incident become a template for media suppression claims from any direction? Because that’s dangerous.

## Bottom line

Yes: A man has been arrested for shooting into an occupied ABC affiliate building in Sacramento. Yes: it happened just after protests over Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension. But *no*, we do *not* yet have proof that the suspect is “radical leftist,” an “attorney,” or even that this was a politically motivated attack.  

We believe in free speech, but we don’t believe in letting fear, assumptions, or ideological tribalism shape the narrative. Let’s keep the pressure on facts. Let’s call out violence when it happens, not when it fits our political narrative. Because America deserves more than slogans and sensational headlines.
