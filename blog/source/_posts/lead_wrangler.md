It seems like construction doesn’t just build houses—it builds chaos. Between door-knocking, juggling leads, and managing jobs, keeping track of it all can feel like herding cats with a lasso. Enter **Lead Wrangler**, a modern, **address-first CRM** built to wrangle leads, keep pipelines clean, and actually *work* for field crews.

### Why Another CRM? Because the Others Don’t Get It

Most CRMs are bloated—stuffed with features for scheduling, invoicing, payments, or a dozen things you didn’t ask for. **Lead Wrangler trims the fat**. It focuses on what really matters:  
- Anchoring every lead and job to an **address**.  
- Replicating the best of **Monday.com’s boards and workflows**.  
- Staying clean, mobile-friendly, and AI-native.  

If you’re knocking on doors, chasing hail damage, or running a remodeling crew, this is your **digital clipboard**—but faster, smarter, and impossible to misplace.  

### From Lead to Job (Without the Mess)

Here’s the flow:  
**Lead → Opportunity → Customer → Sale → Project → Service.**  
Every stage is mapped, tracked, and automated, but **the address ties it all together**. That way, duplicates disappear, notes stay attached to the right property, and the full job history is always one click away.  

Boards, dashboards, and automations keep things organized while **AI features** handle the heavy lifting:  
- Summarizing visit notes.  
- Scoring leads (0–100).  
- Drafting follow-up texts in your voice.  
- Suggesting next actions.  
- Running **semantic search** across your entire database.  

### Built for the Crew, Not Just the Office

Different roles, different needs:  
- **Door-Knockers**: Fast capture, map view, offline support.  
- **Sales Leads**: Pipeline control, qualification, handoffs.  
- **Back Office**: Deduping, service intake, data hygiene.  
- **Owners/Admins**: Cross-market dashboards and permissions.  

It’s not a one-size-fits-all mess—it’s **role-driven** clarity.

### A Touch of Texas

The UI is clean, minimal, and **Texas-flavored**. Longhorn copper accents, dark/light mode parity, and subtle micro-interactions make it both professional and fun. Empty states wink at you: *“Nothing to wrangle here—yet.”*  

### Wrapping It Up

Lead Wrangler isn’t trying to be everything. It’s trying to be the **right thing**:  
A modern, intuitive CRM for crews in the field, owners in the office, and everyone in between.  

It wrangles chaos, one address at a time.
