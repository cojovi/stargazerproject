# The Enhanced Games: Redefining Athletic Excellence

The Enhanced Games is a pioneering initiative set to revolutionize the sports world by fully embracing the integration of scientific advancements with human athletic performance. Backed by industry giants like Peter Thiel, Christian Angermayer, and Balaji Srinivasan, this movement is not just about pushing the boundaries of human capabilities but also about reimagining the very essence of competitive sports ([source](https://enhanced.org/)).

## Mission and Vision

At its core, the Enhanced Games seeks to challenge and redefine the traditional norms surrounding sports, especially the contentious issue of performance enhancements. In a world where the line between technological advancement and natural ability is increasingly blurred, the Enhanced Games proposes a future where this integration is not only accepted but celebrated for its potential to elevate human achievement to unprecedented levels.

### Safety and Fairness

A foundational pillar of the Enhanced Games is its unwavering commitment to athlete safety and fairness. This initiative starkly contrasts with current practices by implementing comprehensive health checks instead of focusing solely on drug testing. The aim is to ensure athletes are not only at their peak performance but also in optimal health, free from the risks associated with undisclosed health conditions 

### Embracing Scientific Achievement

The event plan of the Enhanced Games is meticulously designed to highlight individual excellence and innovation. By focusing on sports that align with these principles, such as athletics, aquatics, gymnastics, strength, and combat, the Games emphasize the importance of operational efficiency and the celebration of personal achievements. Moreover, a significant aspect of this initiative is its commitment to fairly compensating athletes, ensuring they receive a share of the event's profits—a move that starkly contrasts with the revenue distribution models of traditional Olympic events ([source](https://enhanced.org/event-plan)).
